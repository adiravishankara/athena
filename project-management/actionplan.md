# Action Plan for NotebookLM Integration

## Repository Analysis
The repository pHo9UBenaA/notebooklm-automation-alpha appears to be a Chrome extension that automates NotebookLM interactions using Chrome scripting APIs. However, I need more information about the specific implementation since I can't see the full source code, particularly:

1. How does it access the NotebookLM dashboard?
2. How does it extract notebook IDs and names?
3. How does it handle the source addition process?

## Questions to Resolve
1. Can you share the content of their `notebookService.ts` or similar file that handles NotebookLM interactions?
2. Do they have any specific content scripts that inject code into the NotebookLM dashboard?
3. What Chrome APIs are they using for scripting (e.g., chrome.scripting.executeScript)?

## Preliminary Implementation Plan
Based on the repository structure and available information:

1. **Service Layer**
   - Create a NotebookLMService class to handle all NotebookLM interactions
   - Implement methods for:
     - Getting notebook list
     - Adding sources to notebooks
     - Error handling

2. **Chrome Scripting**
   - Use chrome.scripting.executeScript to inject code into NotebookLM
   - Need to identify the correct selectors and DOM elements to interact with

3. **Integration Steps**
   - Implement notebook list retrieval
   - Implement source addition
   - Update UI to use real NotebookLM data

## Next Steps
Before proceeding with implementation, we need:
1. Access to their service implementation details
2. Understanding of their DOM interaction approach
3. Review of their Chrome scripting implementation

Could you help provide access to these implementation details from the repository?
